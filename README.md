# To the Leaf
The stars are amoung the heavens, 
you picked one to chase.
Stepping on the tree trunks, 
stubborn as the earth.
Peeking underneath the humanity,
there lie roots to the abyss.
Drills deep in the darkness,
all to fortify the base.

When you reach for the heavens and expand the earth,
be mindful for what is underneath.
